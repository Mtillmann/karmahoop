	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	<p>The five-character-code is permutated to each of the 32 possibly 
	combinations of upper- and lowercase chars. Then the corresponding
	image's thumbnail is loaded from imgur and it is checked whether or
	not the thumbnail is 160pixels in height. A lower height of 81pixel
	indicates that the request was 404 because thats the height of
	imgur's error picture.</p>
	
	<h2>r<sup>1</sup>, r<sup>2</sup>, f, g+?</h2>
	<p>Those links point to reddit submission links. <sup>1</sup> is the
	raw image url, <sup>2</sup> is the embedded view on imgur.com (no "i"
	subdomain and no file extension). If the image has been submitted
	to reddit already you could find the related discussion. Since
	imgur.com does not care about the original extension (I only use .jpg)
	it is possible that the raw url link may be wrong because the image
	was uploaded and submitted with another file extension (ie .gif, .png).
	<em>If this is the case you are in luck and will be able to  repost the image for
	great justice!</em>
	</p>
	<p>The f and the g+ link let you post the image to facebook or
	google+.</p>
	<p>The first link goes to the image's embedded imgur.com view where
	you can download the image in full resolution or request deletion of
	the image.</p>
	
	<h2>What kind of Server is needed?</h2>
	<p>None! You can download the whole thing from github, unpack and
	run it from your disk. Or host a copy it on your own server.</p>
	
	<h2>What license is karmahoop released under?</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Images and JSONP?</h2>
	<p>I tried to access the images' response codes through jsonp. 
	It works but there is no error handling for 404 and requests that 
	are valid throw an 	error as they contain binary image data but 
	not valid javascript/json. 	It would have been nice also to be 
	able to use the HEAD method for more compact requests and 
	responses but that also does not work
	as expected...</p>
	
	<h2>Where does the content come from?</h2>
	<p>All images are loaded from <a href="http://imgur.com">imgur.com</a>.
	Imgur is image sharing site that is heavily used by the community
	of <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit.com</a>. All images have
	been submitted by users of imgur.com and are not preselected in any
	way. If you find offensive material please report it to imgur.com.</p>

	<h2>Is this a good idea?</h2>
	<p>Propably not. I hope imgur.com does not take damage from this brute force 
	method of snooping. The actual hit ratio per code is between 0% and 20%. For every
	image you see there are 5-15 requests that fail.</p>

	<h2>Does it mine bitcoins?</h2>
	<p><a href="#" onclick="alert('NOPE');alert('Chuck Testa');return false">Yes</a>.</p>

	<h2>Next steps</h2>
	<p>I will try to improve error handling and implement a method to
	inform you when all images for one code have loaded (or none at all
	were found). Also i'd like to put links to tineye.com and google's
	image search, where you use an image as the search query. Unfortunately
	both services seem to have no ways of submitting an image through
	the url.</p>
